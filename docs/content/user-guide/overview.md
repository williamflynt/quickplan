## Key Concepts

### Tasks

Tasks are the fundamental building blocks of your project. Each task represents a unit of work with:

- A unique name or identifier
- An estimated duration
- Optional dependencies on other tasks

### Dependencies

Dependencies define the relationships between tasks. When Task B depends on Task A, Task B cannot start until Task A is complete.

### PERT Charts

Program Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT) charts are a visual representation of your project's tasks and their dependencies. They help you:

- Understand the sequence of work
- Identify parallel work streams
- Find the critical path
- Estimate project duration

### Critical Path

The critical path is the longest sequence of dependent tasks that determines the minimum time needed to complete the project. Any delay in critical path tasks will delay the entire project.
