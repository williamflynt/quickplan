# Creating Projects

Learn how to create and manage projects in QuickPlan.

## Starting a New Project

QuickPlan currently works with in-memory projects. When you open the application, you start with a blank canvas ready for your project.

!!! note
    Currently, QuickPlan does not have persistent storage. Your project data is stored in browser memory and will be lost when you close the application. Make sure to export or save your work if needed.

## Defining Tasks

### Basic Task Properties

Each task in QuickPlan has the following properties:

- **Name** - A unique identifier for the task
- **Duration** - Estimated time to complete the task
- **Description** (optional) - Additional details about the task

### Adding a Task

1. Click the "Add Task" button in the interface
2. Fill in the task details:
   - Enter a descriptive name
   - Set the estimated duration
   - Add any notes or description
3. Save the task

### Editing Tasks

To modify an existing task:

1. Click on the task in the chart or task list
2. Update the desired properties
3. Save your changes

The PERT chart will automatically update to reflect your changes.

### Deleting Tasks

To remove a task:

1. Select the task you want to delete
2. Click the "Delete" button
3. Confirm the deletion

!!! warning
    Deleting a task will also remove all dependencies associated with that task.

## Organizing Your Project

### Task Naming

Use clear, descriptive names for your tasks. Good task names help you and your team quickly understand the project structure.

**Examples:**
- ✓ "Design Database Schema"
- ✓ "Implement User Authentication"
- ✗ "Task 1"
- ✗ "Do stuff"

### Estimating Duration

Be realistic with your duration estimates. Consider:

- The complexity of the work
- Available resources
- Potential risks or blockers
- Historical data from similar tasks

### Breaking Down Work

Large tasks should be broken down into smaller, manageable pieces. This provides:

- Better estimation accuracy
- Clearer progress tracking
- More flexibility in planning
